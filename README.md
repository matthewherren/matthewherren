## To the original owner of this account:
This account was originally set up with a primary email that I (the author of this note, who is not the creator of this GitHub account) now own and use.
I could not figure out how to get in touch with you, the creator of this GitHub account, in order to ask you to disassociate my email from this account.
So, in order to recover that email and associate it with my current GitHub account, I reset this account's password (using said email). Sorry for the inconvenience!

If you'd like to get in touch with me in order to regain control of this account and associate it with a current email that you use, please email me at `A@B.C` where `A=matthewherren-account-recovery-1`, `B=duckbreeze` and `C=com`.
If you can verify your identity to me, I will associate the account with a current email of yours and provide you with the password.

As this account is a decade old and has had no activity in that time, I may delete this account after July 1, 2025 (two years from now) if it's not claimed.

Best,
Matthew
